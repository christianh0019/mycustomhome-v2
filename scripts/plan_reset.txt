// Initialize Supabase (Use VITE_ env vars if available, or just hardcoded for this one-off if needed, 
// but best to read from .env or process.env if we can access them. 
// Since this RunCommand might not have the env vars loaded, I will check the file structure first or ask user.
// actually, I'll try to rely on the existing service configuration if possible, but that's browser logic.
// I'll assume standard node script execution.)

// WAIT. I don't have the Supabase Service Key in cleartext usually. 
// I'll try to use the client key since I'm just updating a row I might have access to if RLS allows, 
// OR I'll just write the code to use the existing `supabase.ts` if I can run it in a browser context or similar?
// No, `run_command` is terminal.
// I will just create a script that I can run or I will implement a "Reset" button in the UI temporarily 
// to let the user do it themselves, OR I will try to use a SQL command if I had that tool (I don't).

// BETTER APPROACH: 
// I will create a temporary "Admin/Debug" component or button in `Settings` or `Roadmap` that the user can click 
// to "Reset Account". This is safer and uses the existing Auth context.
// User asked me to "set my account back". 
// I'll make a `DebugResetButton.tsx` and mount it somewhere temporarily, or better yet,
// I'll modify `RoadmapService` to have a `resetProgress` function and call it via a temporary modification to a file.

console.log("Plan: Add reset functionality to RoadmapService and trigger it.");
